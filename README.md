The project contains 2 folder the frontend with name "crowdup" and the backend with name "final_dotnet"

# How to run them both

## crowdup(frontend)

just run 2 commands 
`npm i`

`npm run dev`

and the frontend will start 

## final_dotnet(backend)

now to start the backend simply do 

`dotnet run`


the project not maintained alot of bugs and there is no alot features and the frontend has alot of bugs and broken dependencies and u may need to force install the packages it was a learning path to me how to connect both the front and the backend
and it was a little  challenging and very benefint road to improve my skills
